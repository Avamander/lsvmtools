To clone a Hyper-V VM:

    (1) Rename VM to the name you would like your clone to have:

	PS> Rename-VM ubuntu.v1 -NewName ubuntu.v2

    (2) Export the VM by right clicking and selecting "Export"

    (3) Now rename VM back to original name:

	PS> Rename-VM ubuntu.v2 -NewName ubuntu.v1

    (4) Right-click on host machine in left panel and select "Import"

    (5) Import the VM (it will have the name "ubuntu.v2"

*The step above are to get around not being able to rename of VM when it is
exported or imported.
